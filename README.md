# Upper_Confidence_Bound
# I am gonna using some math function, so I import math
# First i create my variables, I have 10000 values, so I create N = 10000 and 10 columns, d = 10 it will be useful later
# Then I create empty list for "ads_selected", my "numbers_of_selections" will we a list with a 10 columns, so i multiply it by my variable "d"
# Also my "sums_of_rewards" will be a list multiply by my variable "d", I create variable "total_reward" for future
# Now I make "for loop" from 0 to my N variable so 10000, then I create variable "ad" and "max_upper_bound" variable
# In my "for loop" i create new "for loop" from 0 to my "d" variable, so (10) "if numbers_of_selections of index i is graeater than zero then
# My new variable "average_reward" is "sums_of_rewards of index i / numbers_of_selections of index i"
